# Historical-ads-in-NA

We (Amitai Gispan and I) collected from the collections of Duke University, with use of Python's library of Beutiful soup to scrape the metadata of two of their ad collections. The project includes the building a dataset from a library site and describing insights about the ads were over time in North America. 

This prject is descriptive statistics of those ads.
